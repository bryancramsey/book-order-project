# Book Order Project
This was a group project for a C++ course. I wrote both Order and OrderList files, as well as the majority of the Source.cpp file. 

## Assignment
The assignment was to create an app for managing customers and their corresponding book orders for a book store. A simple command line user interface was used to provide the option to place, update, cancel, checkout, or print orders. All data is loaded and saved to a formatted txt file. A linkedlist data structure was provided as a base class for the order and customer lists.
